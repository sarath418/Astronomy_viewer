            <h2>lunar eclipse</h2>
            <p>Date:25 March 2024</p>
            <p>Location:It will be fully visible from most of the Americas, will be seen rising over Australia and eastern Asia, and setting over western parts of Africa and Europe</p>
            <p>Details:A penumbral lunar eclipse will take place on Monday, March 25, 2024. It will be visible to the naked eye as 95.57% of the Moon will be immersed in Earth's penumbral shadow</p>

            <h2>Solar eclipse</h2>
            <p>Date: April 8, 2024</p>
            <p>Location:where totality will be visible in Mexico, the United States, and Canada.[6] It will also be the last total solar eclipse visible in the Contiguous United States until August 23, 2044</p>
            <p>Details:A total solar eclipse will take place at the Moon's ascending node on Monday, April 8, 2024, visible across North America and dubbed the Great North American Eclipse (also Great American Total Solar Eclipse and Great American Eclipse) by some of the media.[1][2][3] A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs only in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide.

Occurring only one day after perigee (perigee on Sunday, April 7, 2024), the Moon's apparent diameter will be 5.5% larger than average. With a magnitude of 1.0566, its longest duration of totality will be of four minutes and 28.13 seconds near the town of Nazas, Mexico (~6 km north), and the nearby city of Torreón.

This eclipse will be the first total solar eclipse to be visible in Canada since February 26, 1979,[4] the first in Mexico since July 11, 1991,[5] and the first in the U.S. since August 21, 2017.</p>

            <p>Location:It will be completely visible over western parts of Africa and Europe, South and eastern North America, will be seen rising over the rest of North America, and setting over the rest of Africa and Europe</p>
            <p>Details:A partial lunar eclipse will take place on Wednesday, 18 September 2024, the second of two lunar eclipses in 2024 and the final partial lunar eclipse of Lunar Saros 118</p>

            <h2>Solar eclipse</h2>
            <p>Date: October 2, 2024</p>
            <p>Location: Observed from everywhere</p>
            <p>Details:An annular solar eclipse will occur on October 2, 2024. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide.

Other than Easter Island and a small portion near the southern tips of Argentina and Chile, the path of the eclipse's antumbra will be entirely over the Pacific Ocean. The penumbra will be visible from southern South America, Hawaii and portions of Antarctica. Eclipse magnitude is 0.93261, occurring only 56 minutes before apogee</p>

            <h2>Solar eclipse </h2>
            <p>Date:August 12, 2026</p>
            <p>Location: The total eclipse will pass over the Arctic, Greenland, Iceland, Atlantic Ocean and northern Spain</p>
            <p>Details:A total solar eclipse will occur at the Moon's descending node of the orbit on Wednesday, August 12, 2026, 2 days past perigee (Perigee on Monday, August 10, 2026), in North America and Europe. The total eclipse will pass over the Arctic, Greenland, Iceland, Atlantic Ocean and northern Spain. The points of greatest duration and greatest eclipse will be just 45 km off the western coast of Iceland by 65°10.3' N and 25°12.3' W, where the totality will last 2m 18.21s. It will be the first total eclipse visible in Iceland since June 30, 1954, also Solar Saros series 126 (descending node), and the only one to occur in the 21st century as the next one will be in 2196.

Occurring only 2.3 days after perigee (Perigee on August 10, 2026), the Moon's apparent diameter will be larger. Lunar Perigee will occur on Monday, August 10, 2026, two days before the total solar eclipse.

The total eclipse will pass over northern Spain from the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean coast as well as the Balearic Islands. The total eclipse will be visible from the cities of Valencia, Zaragoza, Palma and Bilbao but both Madrid and Barcelona will be just outside the path of totality.

The last total eclipse in continental Europe occurred on March 29, 2006 and in continental part of European Union it occurred on August 11, 1999. The last total solar eclipse happened in Spain on August 30, 1905 and followed a similar path across the country. The next total eclipse visible in Spain will happen less than a year later on 2 August 2027. A partial eclipse will cover more than 90% of the area of the sun in Ireland, Great Britain, Portugal, France, Italy, the Balkans and North Africa and to a lesser extent in most of Europe, North Africa and North America.</p>

It contains total eclipses from March 27, 1522 through May 30, 1612 and hybrid eclipses from June 10, 1630 through July 24, 1702, and annular eclipses from August 4, 1720 through June 18, 2243.

            <p>Location: Observatory Hill</p>
            <p>Details:(137108) 1999 AN10 is a kilometer-length near-Earth asteroid and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group. It was discovered by LINEAR on 13 January 1999.[5]

On 7 August 2027, this asteroid will pass at about 0.00261 AU (390,000 km; 243,000 mi; 1.02 LD) of the Earth’s center.[6][1][7][8] During the close approach, it should peak at about apparent magnitude 7.3,[9] and will be visible in binoculars.

1999 AN10 has a well-determined orbit with an observation arc of 65 years.[1] It was found by Andreas Doppler and Arno Gnädig in precovery images from 1955.[1] When astronomers had an observation arc of the object of 123 days, computations gave a 1 in 10 million chance it would return on an impact trajectory in 2039.[10]

On 7 August 1946, the asteroid passed 0.00625 AU (935,000 km; 581,000 mi) from Earth and then 0.00404 AU (604,000 km; 376,000 mi) from the Moon</p>

            <p>Details:A total solar eclipse will occur on Saturday, July 22, 2028. The central line of the path of the eclipse will cross the Australian continent from the Kimberley region in the north west and continue in a south-easterly direction through Western Australia, the Northern Territory, south-west Queensland and New South Wales, close to the towns of Wyndham, Kununurra, Tennant Creek, Birdsville, Bourke and Dubbo, and continuing on through the centre of Sydney, where the eclipse will have a duration of over three minutes.

            <p>Date: October 26, 2028</p>
            <p>Location: Observatory Hill</p>
            <p>Details:Three months after its discovery on 6 December 1997 by James V. Scotti of the University of Arizona's Spacewatch Project, the asteroid was predicted to make an exceptionally close approach to Earth on 28 October 2028. Additional precovery observations of the asteroid from 1990 were quickly found that refined the orbit and it is now known the asteroid will pass Earth on 26 October 2028, at a distance of 929,000 km (2.42 LD). During the close approach, the asteroid should peak at about apparent magnitude 8.2 and will be visible in binoculars.

1997 XF11 measures between 0.7 and 1.4 kilometers in diameter.

This asteroid also regularly comes near the large asteroid Pallas</p>
